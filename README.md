 Data science and python projects and exercises.

## [Exercise 1 : visualizations.](https://github.com/ALAN-DAN/python-projects/blob/master/data_analysis/visualizacion_datos_subplots_3D.ipynb) 
The analyzed dataset contains information about heart diseases and symptoms. 
This file contains several plot and subplots to show the relation between symptoms and healthy or sick patients.

* Quality report (shows the general structure of the dataset)
* Basic graphs of healthy and sickness patients, considering blood pressure and cholesterol level.
* Plotting gender of patients, considering chest pain and cholesterol level.
* Several subplots of healthy and sickness patients, considering all the variables (symptoms).
* 3D Plot of healthy and sickness patients.
* 3D Subplot function, 3D subplots of healthy and sickness patients, considering all the variables (symptoms).
* Dynamic 3D plot.

## [Project 1 : Financial products comparative and forecasting.](https://github.com/ALAN-DAN/python-projects/blob/master/data_analysis/stock_forecast/proyecto_base_2.ipynb)
This project contains a comparative between stock market indexes (IPC and S&P500) and some fintech project investments, 
investments funds and FAANG stockÂ´s. 
Also three diferent predictive models and the corresponding plots.

* Ploting IPC vs invesment funds returns.
* Function to obtain basic returns statistics.
* Ploting IPC vs fintech invesments returns.
* Ploting IPC vs FAANG returns.
* Function to obtain basic returns and price statistics.
* Subplots of FAANG stocks and indexes.
* Historical S&P500 price plot.
* Data preparation and split.
* Creation and training of lineal regression model.
* Forecast plot(lineal regression).
* Creation and training of SVR model.
* Forecast plot(SVR).

### [Project 1 (continuation) : RNN-LSTM model (tensorflow).](https://github.com/ALAN-DAN/python-projects/blob/master/data_analysis/stock_forecast/Modelo%20LSTM.ipynb)
The last predictive model LSTM.

* Historical S&P500 price plot.
* Data preparation and split.
* Creation and training of LSTM model.
* Forecast plot(LSTM).
